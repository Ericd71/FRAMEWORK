# 3D Mesh Viewer - Computer Graphics Project at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF)

A interactive 3D mesh visualization tool built with C++. This project demonstrates fundamental computer graphics concepts including mesh rendering, camera controls, and real-time interaction.
Framework was given to us students and we had to build the project

## Features

- **3D Mesh Rendering**: Load and display 3D models with vertex and face data
- **Interactive Camera**: 
  - Mouse drag to rotate view
  - Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Real-time Controls**: Dynamic object manipulation in 3D space
- **Modern Graphics**: Uses ModernGL for high-performance OpenGL rendering

## Technical Implementation

- **Rendering**: ModernGL with vertex buffers and shaders
- **Mesh Processing**: Handles vertices, faces, and normals
- **Camera System**: Arcball-style rotation and zoom controls
- **Input Handling**: Mouse-based interaction for intuitive 3D navigation

## Usage
TODO
Run the main script to launch the 3D viewer:


Use your mouse to rotate and zoom around the 3D model.
Academic Context

This project was developed for a Computer Graphics course, focusing on practical implementation of 3D rendering techniques and interactive graphics programming.
